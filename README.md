// hello! Mckinney checking in, looking forward to working on this with y'all

/* Hello everyone. This is Kenwar Dhillon. I am happy and looking forward to working on this project with you all and making it complete. Some particle effects that I will be working on are making a snow orb fall to a certain point (possibly make it sparkling) and making snowflakes fall straight down after the snow orb explodes. */

// Hello this is Fabian, Happy to be here!
